Jenkins is an open source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language.
It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.

Pipelines automate testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time and facilitates the integration of disparate branches of the code into a main branch.
They also rapidly detect defects in a code base, build the software, automate testing of their builds, prepare the code base for deployment (delivery), 
and ultimately deploy code to containers and virtual machines, as well as bare metal and cloud servers.
There are several commercial versions of Jenkins. This definition only describes the upstream open source project.

Jenkins is a server-based application and requires a web server like Apache Tomcat to run on various platforms like Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix, etc.
To use Jenkins, you need to create pipelines which are a series of steps that a Jenkins server will take.
Jenkins Continuous Integration Pipeline is a powerful instrument that consists of a set of tools designed to 
host, monitor, compile and test code, or code changes, like:

Continuous Integration Server (Jenkins, Bamboo, CruiseControl, TeamCity, and others)
Source Control Tool (e.g., CVS, SVN, GIT, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase and others)
Build tool (Make, ANT, Maven, Ivy, Gradle, and others)
Automation testing framework (Selenium, Appium, TestComplete, UFT, and others)
